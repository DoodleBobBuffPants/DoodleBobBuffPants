# Sprint pizza retrospective

## Equipment

- Post-it notes
- Pens

## Setting the scene

We will now becomes chefs and work together to create a _Sprint pizza_

## Gathering ingredients

We will each write our thoughts about the sprint onto post-it notes, and those notes will make the ingredients for our pizza

## Refining ingredients

We will go through the ingredients and merge duplicates into one big ingredient, and filter the remaining ingredients down to a reasonable number

Ingredients can be briefly discussed as we refine, but major discussion will be for later

## Creating the pizza

Each ingredient will go onto its own slice for the overall Sprint pizza

## Eating the pizza

We will each take a slice from the pizza

We will then take it in turns to say our thoughts about the slice and its ingredients, and whether we think the ingredient is an overall positive or negative

Others can then add their thoughts in support or opposition, and we can decide on the overall positiveness or negativeness for the ingredient, creating actions as necessary

We will iterate on eating the pizza until all slices are gone

Filtered-out ingredients can be discussed if there is time

To finish our reflections on the pizza, we can talk about which ingredient is the worst (e.g. the pineapple of the sprint) and which is the best (e.g. the pepperoni of the sprint)
