# Card battler retrospective

I ran a card battler themed retrospective which went positively, so this is a write-up of the process which can be shared.

## Setting the scene

As with all good tabletop adventures, it's important to set the scene to get everyone in the right frame of mind, and that
applies to this retrospective too!

You can choose any scene you like. Here's what I went for: _After a 2 week long battle, us adventurers are now sat in this
tavern celebrating and sharing the stories of our adventure._

## Icebreaker

It's important to make the first activity an icebreaker to get people talking. For maximum immersion, you can also rely on
your scene for topics.

## Updating character sheets

This section is where we'll generate the topics for discussion. We frame this as updating our character sheets to use our
latest adventure (the last sprint, for example) to generate new traits / bios.

Each new item is to be written on a separate piece of card. Any writing promp will do. I went for:
- _Include what you feel you have done well, any achievements, or any other positive topic_
- _Include what you feel has not gone so well, anything that can be improved, or any other unresolved issue_

## Weighting the cards

First we'll need to split the group into two teams. One team will have all the positive cards, and the other will have all
the negative cards.

Each team will need to weight all their cards on a scale from 1 to _n_ based on how important or impactful they feel that
card is. 1 will be least important / impactful, and _n_ will be most. You will have to choose _n_ based on the number of
cards each team has.

Try and get the teams to have an equal number of cards, such as by removing duplicates or low rated cards from the team with
excess cards. If this isn't possible, the excess cards can be shared evenly among the teams.

## Battle!

It's time to face off! As the facilitator you will need to choose one person from each team to pick a card from their side
and place it in the center of the table at the same time.

The chosen people will then take it in turns to read out their card and justify the weight they chose. You can then give
the opposing team an opportunity to contest the weight, as long as they can justify lowering or raising it.

It is expected that the chosen people will talk, but let them know that they may tag in a team member if they need to. Use
your judgement as a facilitator here.

After discussions, the highest card goes into a winner pile, and the losing card goes into a loser pile.

Repeat this process by continuing to choose different people from each team to battle against each other until all cards
are used. If there is an odd card left over, it automatically goes into the winner pile.

## Which adventuring elements will we bring forward?

Now that the battle is over, we've identified in the winner pile the more important elements of the previous adventure.

Lay out all the cards, then go through them one by one asking everyone present if there is something there that can be
brought forward to the next adventure (e.g. sprint). This is where actions will be generated. Make sure each action has
an owner.

If time is permitting, you may also do this for the loser pile.

## Additional notes

- _Spend as long as you feel you need to for each section_
- _Choosing different people to battle is so everyone has a fair chance to speak. Use your judgement here_
